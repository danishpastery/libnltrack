# What is libnltrack? #
LNT (libnltrack) is a usefull library written in C to open, create, modify and save a Nolimits Roller Coaster Track File. This Library contains many functions to add, modify, delete track parts, like supports, segments, track nodes, coaster types, beziers and many more.

One day we have talked about the SDK we miss for NoLimits to develop easy 3rd party tools for NoLimits. However, for many programmers, it is troublesome to deal with the nltrack file and type. We thought we would have a crack at developing our own SDK for Nolimits.
With this library, it will make it a lot easier for people to developer thier own NoLimits 3rd party tools. It's also great for beginners! libnltrack is very interesting, understandable and easy to use functions, perfect for beginners to start making their own tools.

# What can libnltrack do? #

I began the development of libnltrack on the 6th April 2008. Since the last month, the development runs very fast.

## The libnltrack project website is online! ##
The countdown runs for the release of libnltrack.
I am almost finished with the development of the library, so I have to document it now. It supports almost everything on the nltrack files, except the functions for terrain and catwalk.
The library will be able to add, modify, delete supports, nodes, beziers, segments, track settings and many more.

You can find a full list of the features here.

I will report the development progress in the next days.
